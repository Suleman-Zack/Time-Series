This repository presents a tutorial for basic understanding of time series forecasting and its implementation in Python. The problem is to predict the daily temperature in a particular area at a 10mins interval.
* Time series data: Is a set of observations collected or recorded sequentially with respect to a specific time interval.
* Time Series Analysis: The analysis and probing to understand historical time series data.
* Time Series Forecasting: The use of historical time series data to predict future observations.


 This Repository is purposefully for Time Series Analysis. The repo should include;
* Univariate Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA
* Univariate Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning Models
* Univariate Time Series Forecasting with Neural Networks (To be added later)
